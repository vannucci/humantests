#React Test v1
Testing yourself in situations which mimic the environment in which you will have to use your skills is the best way to effectively learn a skill. You wouldn't just watch a football play happen on television and then assume you know it perfectly. Nor would you simply read a mathematical theorem repeatedly, or read React docs over and over and then assume you know how to do it. You must test yourself, both with declarative knowledge ('A component in React is...') and procedural knowledge ('This is how you write a React component...'). To that end, this is the first of a series of tests I have made to test my own knowledge of different web dev concepts. This is by no means the final version!! These tests will be updated, and often many times, as better questions are figured out. Ten questions seems to be a good place to start with this. Also, while it may seem that reading often and testing only a few times is a good idea, research has shown that testing more than you simply read information is [far more effective](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ulterior-motives/201108/test-yourself-learn-better) at connecting the knowledge in your brain.

1. What is the general form of a react component, both functional and class based?

2. What are lifecycle methods and write down as many as you can below
    Lifecycle methods are functions which are called at particular times when a component is being called by React. As an example, the `render()` method is called when a component is created and thus needs to be rendered. Other examples include the `constructor()` method, `componentDidMount()` when the component has successfully mounted into the DOM, `componentWillMount()` which I don't understand.

3. Give an example of event handling, and explain how you set it up. For example, a button where when clicked it toggles the component state from 'on' and 'off'.

4. What is the `.map()` function, and where can it be used in React?

5. Write a form component which includes first and last name, email, and two passwords which check for agreement and display only dots

6. Describe in your own words how React moves data between different components. How would you move data from a Parent to a Child component, between two Sibling components, and from a Child to a Parent component?

7. What is the difference between the composition and inheritance model in React? Give an example of each.

8. List the 'Steps of Thinking In React'.
